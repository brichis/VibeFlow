# VibeFlow

**Find your tribe, verify your vibe.**

VibeFlow is a social network for event-based networking that solves the adult friendship crisis by connecting people with genuinely shared interests, verified through actual event attendance.

## The Problem

67% of millennials and Gen Z report feeling lonely despite being more "connected" than ever. Traditional social networks optimize for engagement, not genuine connection. People attend events hoping to meet like-minded individuals but struggle to convert brief encounters into lasting relationships.

## The Solution

VibeFlow analyzes your Eventbrite event history to match you with people who've proven their interests through real-world participation. No more "loves hiking" profiles from couch potatoesâ€”only authentic connections based on verified shared experiences.

## Key Features

- **Interest Verification**: Connects with Eventbrite to analyze actual event attendance
- **Smart Matching**: Algorithm identifies "event twins" with compatible participation patterns  
- **Event-Centric Discovery**: Find connections before, during, or after events

## ðŸš€ Setup ERC-721 NFT Extension

This extension introduces an ERC-721 token contract and demonstrates how to use it, including getting the total supply and holder balance, listing all NFTs from the collection and NFTs from the connected address, and how to transfer NFTs.

The ERC-721 Token Standard introduces a standard for Non-Fungible Tokens ([EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)), in other words, each token is unique.

The ERC-721 token contract is implemented using the [ERC-721 token implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol) from OpenZeppelin.

The ERC-721 token implementation uses the [ERC-721 Enumerable extension](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol) from OpenZeppelin to list all tokens from the collection and all the tokens owned by an address. You can remove this if you plan to use an indexer, like a Subgraph or Ponder ([extensions available](https://scaffoldeth.io/extensions)).

### Setup

Deploy your contract running ```yarn deploy```

### Interact with the NFT

Start the front-end with ```yarn start``` and go to the _/erc721_ page to interact with your deployed ERC-721 token.

You can check the code at ```packages/nextjs/app/erc721```.
