# VibeFlow

**Find your tribe, verify your vibe.**

VibeFlow is a social network for event-based networking that solves the adult friendship crisis by connecting people with genuinely shared interests, verified through actual event attendance.

## The Problem

67% of millennials and Gen Z report feeling lonely despite being more "connected" than ever. Traditional social networks optimize for engagement, not genuine connection. People attend events hoping to meet like-minded individuals but struggle to convert brief encounters into lasting relationships.


## The Solution
VibeFlow analyzes your Eventbrite event history to match you with people who've proven their interests through real-world participation. No more "loves hiking" profiles from couch potatoes—only authentic connections based on verified shared experiences.

## Key Features

- **Interest Verification**: Connects with Eventbrite to analyze actual event attendance
- **Smart Matching**: Algorithm identifies "event twins" with compatible participation patterns  
- **Event-Centric Discovery**: Find connections before, during, or after events
- **Digital Friendship Bracelets**: NFTs to commemorate meaningful connections
- **Privacy-First**: No public browsing of profiles without mutual interest
